		<p style="color:darkgoldenrod;">What is solar system?</p>
		<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. </p>
		<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€“ the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>
